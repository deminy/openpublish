Drupal module [OpenPublish](https://www.drupal.org/project/openpublish) is kind of [dead](https://www.drupal.org/node/2088157).
Considering that it's probably the only choice for that type of Drupal modules, I'm using this GitHub repository to include
community and personal updates of it.

This is just to make OpenPublish working for me. Sorry but I have no intent nor enough time to take over development work of that
module.
